# HACK THIS FALL 2024 VIRTUAL- FOCUS TIMER
### Created by P. Tejas Prateek (https://github.com/Tejas-jsc)

AIM OF THIS PROJECT = Developing a focus timer which helps focusing on your tasks better by boosting your productivity and attention span by gamifying your tasks and much more... 
## Please read through the entire README to fully understand what makes this project unique!

## Table of contents
 FEATURES = 1. This prototye lets the user set a pomodoro timer,focus timer or a custom timer which enhances the user experience by offering flexibility to the user to decide his own focus duration and break duration
2. The video playing in the bg matches with the font style creating a calm and relaxed atmosphere that helps users stay motivated.
3. The timer is visually represented as a progress circle, with the remaining time shown in a centered label. The timer’s progress is dynamically updated in real 
    time with an animated circle that visually fills and empties based on the time remaining.
4. The app is mobile-responsive, ensuring a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices. The layout adjusts for smaller screen sizes, optimizing the interface for 
    mobile users with smaller buttons and a more compact view.
5. The app includes separate login and signup forms with basic validation. Users can easily switch between the forms, providing a smooth authentication experience with neon- 
    themed buttons for a modern, interactive feel.


Further advancement = 1. Gamification and Progression
Rewards and Achievements: Integrate a system where users earn points or rewards as they complete sessions or streaks. You could show a "streak counter" (e.g., "5 days in a row!") and unlock achievements for milestones like "First 10 sessions" or "1 Week Streak."
Unlockables: As users progress, they can unlock new timer themes, backgrounds, or even "biomes" (which you've already teased). These can be visually rewarding and add a sense of progression.

2. Motivational Quotes
Focus Quotes: Display motivational quotes on the screen, especially after a session ends or when users are about to start a new one. You could randomize the quotes, or users could submit their favorite ones for the app to use.
Personalized Messages: Add a feature where users can input their own motivational message or mantra, and it shows up at the start or end of the timer.

3. Analytics & Focus Insights
Focus Reports: After each session, users could receive a summary or an analysis of their performance, such as how long they stayed focused, their longest streaks, or how their focus time compares to previous sessions.
Streaks & Milestones: Encourage users to maintain streaks (e.g., "You’ve been focusing for 3 days in a row!") and show milestone markers, like "10 sessions completed," or even progress bars toward bigger goals.

4. Linking the signup and login with a backend like *MongoDB* can prove to be a game changer in storing the users and passwords of the users (including the feature of two step verification, email or *github* login, otp verification)
5. The profile icon can be made functional by providing a edit pfp button where users can upload their custom profile picture 
6. There might be some bugs as this is a prototype

## Acknowledgements
As a complete beginner, participating in my first hackathon was a valuable learning experience. I leveraged various OpenAI tools to assist with coding, problem-solving, and enhancing my understanding of key concepts, which helped me make significant progress throughout the event.
